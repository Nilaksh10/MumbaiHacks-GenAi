GEN_AI MUMBAI_HACKS RESTORE PHOTOS

AllAboutImg is a website that utilizes cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to restore old and blurry face photos. The website offers a free service that allows users to upload their photos and bring them back to life using the GFPGAN model from the Tencent ARC Lab.

The process is simple and easy to use. Users can upload any photo to the website, which will then be sent through the GFPGAN model using a Next.js API route. The restored photo will then be returned to the user, allowing them to keep their memories alive forever.

The GFPGAN model is designed to develop a practical algorithm for real-world face restoration. It leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pre-trained face GAN (e.g., StyleGAN2) for blind face restoration. This means the model can restore the most heavily degraded or blurry photos with high accuracy
